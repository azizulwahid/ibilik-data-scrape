# ibilik-data-scrape
python notebook and raw data for listings on ibilik.my
this repository contains the code for the webscraper along with the raw data used to create my analysis on twitter (https://twitter.com/pingster2008/status/1327921431477252096)
the extract from the notebook is missing a few features compared to the excel file as these new features were created using excel formulas within the excel file itself.
